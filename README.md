# othello
My project to create a bot playing the boardgame Othello, or Reversi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi). I am mostly trying out different techniques to see what works and what doesn't. As I have limited experience working with reinforcement learning most of what I am trying is just my own ideas. The main experiments conducted is found in "Training and evaluating models", while the actual game and models are found in the other files.
