# othello
My project to create a bot playing the boardgame Othello, or Reversi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi). I am mostly trying out different techniques to see what works and what doesn't. Most of what I am trying out is just my own ideas of what might work good. The main experiments conducted is found in "Training and evaluating models", while the actual game and models are found in the other files.
